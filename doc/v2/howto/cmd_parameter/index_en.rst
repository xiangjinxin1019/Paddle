Set Command-line Parameters
===========================
The implementation of the deep learning algorithm has a varity of characteristics, such as running environment, running stage, the struct of models and trainning strategy. PaddlePaddle supports the user to set various command-line parameters flexibly, which help to achieve control of the model traning stage of prediction process.

In this part, we take several actual scenes about the use of some command-line parameters as an example firstly:

..  toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  use_case_cn.md

Then, we summarize and classify the use of all command-line parameters:

..  toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  arguments_cn.md

Finally, the detailed descriptions are given, and we try to explain the properties and significance of these parameters in detail:
